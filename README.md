## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the complete implementation and research work for a **Hybrid AI-Based Phishing URL Detection Framework** developed as part of the **Information Security (CS-3002)** course at **FAST-NUCES Islamabad**.

The project significantly extends a base research paper by integrating **multi-source phishing datasets**, applying **Correlation-Based Feature Selection (CFS)**, and implementing a **three-stage hybrid classification architecture** combining:

- Optimized **Random Forest (RF)**
- Regularized **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- Advanced **Neural Network with Residual Connections + Attention**

The final model achieves **F1-scores ≈ 0.9999** across all evaluation settings.
